This repository includes my contribution to the given Advanced and Robotics Programming course.
Our duty was to perform a speed test using different IPC elements,
I did the shared memory part and named pipe part, that is why I only included these.

$ . install.sh <path name>  !!! BEWARE OF THE LACK OF SLASH BEFORE INSTALL COMMAND !!!
$ ./run.sh <program> <size of array in KB> <size of buffer (only shared memory)>
      note that: 2 for named pipe | 4 for shared memory
